Here's some of the issues we ran into along the way and how we solved them:

Our main issue after typing everything out was that the part of the program
responsible for making children wasn't always making legitimate ones. After some
debugging, we found a couple issues with create_crossover_child, which was
rather unexpected, since that code was provided to us by the instructor.
It may have been that we were using the method wrong, but either way, it's
fixed now.
